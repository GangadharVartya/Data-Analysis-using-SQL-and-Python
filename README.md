Problem statement:

An Airline company inorder to review its profitability and future aspects intends to examine its database to find ways
to raise the flights occupancy rate and, in turn, raise the average profit per seat.

Performed exploratory data analysis (can visualize/notice from source code attached) after establishing the connection with the database

So it seems like " Airbus A319-100 " is having maximum average number of Business class seats.
Also " Airbus A319-100 " is having maximum average number of Economy seats.
And " Boeing 777-300 " is having maximum number of Comfort seats.

While calculating occupancy rate, we can notice it is highest for Boeing 777-300 and lowest for Bombardier CRJ-200 

SUMMARY:


In conclusion, by examining revenue data and making wise choices, airlines may increase their profitability. In this analysis, 
variables like total revenue, average revenue per ticket, and average occupancy per aircraft are important. Airlines can raise their 
profitability by identifying areas for development, adjusting pricing and streamlining existing routes. 
The secret to long-term success in the competitive airline sector is striking a balance between these criteria.
